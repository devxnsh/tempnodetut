/* In Node.js, "globals" refers to a set of objects and functions
 that are available globally throughout the application without having to explicitly import or require them. 
These global objects and functions are part of the Node.js runtime environment, 
and they can be accessed from any module or file in your application.*/

// Some examples of Node.js global objects and functions include:

// __dirname : Path to current directory
// __filename : File Name
// require : function to use modules (CommonJS)
// module : Info about current Module
// process : info about where program is being executed.
